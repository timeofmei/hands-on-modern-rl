# 7.3 Constraint Mechanisms for Policy Updates

## Section Overview

Section 7.2 derived PPO's clipped surrogate objective:

$$L^{\text{CLIP}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \min \left( r_t(\theta) \cdot A_t, \; \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\varepsilon, 1+\varepsilon) \cdot A_t \right) \right]$$

This objective contains a policy ratio $r_t$, a clipping operation, and an outer min. This section answers two questions: **what does this formula protect, and why can we not simply use the vanilla policy gradient?**

The line of reasoning is: the update risk of vanilla policy gradient → importance sampling for data reuse → TRPO's KL-divergence constraint → PPO's clipped approximation. The entire formula is driven by a single motive: **constrain the magnitude of each update so that a single step cannot ruin the policy**.

To keep the derivation concrete, this section uses a single running example throughout: a state $s$ with two actions $a_1, a_2$, where the initial policy assigns $\pi(a_1 \mid s) = 0.6$ and $\pi(a_2 \mid s) = 0.4$. The central question is: what happens if one update pushes $\pi(a_1 \mid s)$ to $0.99$?

  :::

## The Update Risk of Vanilla Policy Gradient

Recall the policy-gradient update from Chapter 5 ([REINFORCE](../chapter05_policy_gradient/reinforce)):

$$\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \cdot \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a \mid s) \cdot A(s,a)$$

When the advantage $A(s,a) > 0$ (better than average), the parameters are updated in the direction that increases $\pi(a \mid s)$. **The problem: there is no upper bound on the magnitude of this update.**

Apply this to the running example. Suppose we sample $(s, a_1)$ with advantage $A(s, a_1) = 2$ and learning rate $\alpha = 0.5$. A single update yields:

|                   | Before | After |
| ----------------- | ------ | ----- |
| $\pi(a_1 \mid s)$ | 0.6    | 0.99  |
| $\pi(a_2 \mid s)$ | 0.4    | 0.01  |

In one step, the probability of $a_1$ rises from 0.6 to 0.99. Yet this is the result of **a single sample** — if the high advantage was partly due to sampling variance, the policy has already compressed the alternative action's probability to 0.01. **Policy updates are irreversible; there is no undo mechanism.**

The next round is worse. Training data was collected under the old policy $\pi_{\text{old}}$, but when we attempt to reuse the same batch, $\pi(a_1 \mid s)$ is already 0.99, far from the 0.6 at which it was sampled. **The old data is stale.**

The core dilemma of vanilla policy gradient is: **single-step updates have high variance, yet policy updates are irreversible**. One bad step renders the entire batch unusable.

> If a single update can damage the policy, then before asking "how much to update," should we not first ensure that the operation of "training a new policy on old data" is itself safe?

## Importance Sampling and Data Reuse

The first problem is data reuse. The sample $(s, a_1)$ was collected under $\pi_{\text{old}}(a_1 \mid s) = 0.6$. Can it be used to update a new policy where $\pi_\theta(a_1 \mid s) = 0.99$?

Mathematically yes, via **importance sampling**. An expectation under one distribution can be rewritten in terms of another using a likelihood ratio:

$$\mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_{\text{old}}} \left[ \frac{\pi_\theta(a \mid s)}{\pi_{\text{old}}(a \mid s)} \cdot f(a) \right] = \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_\theta} [f(a)]$$

This ratio $r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t \mid s_t)}{\pi_{\text{old}}(a_t \mid s_t)}$ is called the **policy ratio** — it measures the change in probability that the new policy assigns to the same $(s,a)$ relative to the old.

Substituting the example:

| Policy                        | $\pi(a_1 \mid s)$ |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Old policy $\pi_{\text{old}}$ | 0.6               |
| New policy $\pi_\theta$       | 0.99              |
| $r_t(\theta) = 0.99 / 0.6$    | **1.65**          |

The new policy makes $a_1$ 1.65× more likely. Incorporating this ratio into the policy gradient yields the importance-sampled objective:

$$L^{\text{IS}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t \left[ r_t(\theta) \cdot A_t \right]$$

In form, old data can now evaluate the new policy. But the value 1.65 also exposes a problem: **the gradient is amplified 1.65×**. If the policy pushes $\pi(a_1 \mid s)$ more aggressively to 0.999, then $r_t = 1.665$; at 0.9999, $r_t = 1.6665$. The larger $r_t$ becomes, the larger the next update, which in turn drives $r_t$ even higher — a **positive feedback loop**.

Importance sampling solves the data-reuse problem but provides no guarantee of safe usage.

> Vanilla policy gradient exhibits update risk in a single step, and importance sampling allows $r_t$ to grow without bound. Can the requirement that "each update be bounded in magnitude" be formulated mathematically?

## TRPO and a KL-Divergence Constraint

In 2015, Schulman et al. proposed: **constrain the distance between the old and new policies directly**. The standard tool for measuring the distance between two distributions is KL divergence, written here as a hard constraint:

$$\max_\theta \; \mathbb{E}_t \left[ r_t(\theta) \cdot A_t \right] \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \mathbb{E}_t \left[ D_{\text{KL}}(\pi_{\text{old}} \| \pi_\theta) \right] \leq \delta$$

$\delta$ is typically 0.01, meaning the policy's behavior distribution may change by at most 1% per update. This defines a **trust region**: the policy may move freely within it, but any update that crosses the boundary is rejected.

Substituting the example. Moving $\pi(a_1 \mid s)$ from 0.6 to 0.99 gives a KL divergence roughly 0.5 or higher, far exceeding $\delta = 0.01$. TRPO would reject this update outright and pull the policy back inside the trust region.

Elegant in theory, but difficult in practice. Solving this constrained optimization requires the Hessian matrix (second derivatives of the parameters). For a network with millions of parameters, the Hessian's dimension is the square of the parameter count and cannot fit in memory. In the LLM setting, the policy itself is a 70B-parameter language model; computing its Hessian is entirely infeasible. TRPO approximates the solution via conjugate gradient, but it remains slow and complex to implement. **The cost of strict constraints is computational expense.**

> TRPO's constraint is so precise that the computational cost becomes prohibitive. Is there a method that is less strict than TRPO yet still effectively bounds the magnitude of each update?

## PPO's Clipping Mechanism

In 2017, Schulman proposed PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) as an engineering approximation to TRPO: **instead of measuring policy distance precisely, $r_t$ is truncated directly** — constrained to the interval $[1-\varepsilon, 1+\varepsilon]$, with any value beyond the bounds clamped to the boundary.

PPO's objective:

$$L^{\text{CLIP}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \min \left( r_t(\theta) \cdot A_t, \; \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\varepsilon, 1+\varepsilon) \cdot A_t \right) \right]$$

Substituting the 1.65 example from above ($\varepsilon = 0.2$, $A_t = 2$):

| Term         | Computation                                          | Value      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Unclipped    | $r_t \cdot A_t = 1.65 \times 2$                      | $3.30$     |
| Clipped      | $\text{clip}(1.65, 0.8, 1.2) \cdot 2 = 1.2 \times 2$ | $2.40$     |
| $\min$ picks | —                                                    | **$2.40$** |

Clipping compresses the larger objective value (3.30) down to 2.40. The objective becomes constant in this interval — **its dependence on $\theta$ vanishes, and the policy is no longer encouraged to increase $\pi(a_1 \mid s)$ further.**

The formula consists of three terms, each with a distinct role:

- **Unclipped term** $r_t(\theta) \cdot A_t$: the standard policy-gradient objective after importance sampling — the product of the policy ratio and the advantage.
- **Clipped term** $\text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\varepsilon, 1+\varepsilon) \cdot A_t$: constrains $r_t$ within $[1-\varepsilon, 1+\varepsilon]$. $\varepsilon$ is typically 0.1 or 0.2, corresponding to a maximum change of 10% or 20% in policy probability.
- **Minimum** $\min(\cdot, \cdot)$: selects the more conservative of the two values.

### Directionality of the Clipping Mechanism

The effect of clipping depends on the sign of the advantage $A_t$, with the upper and lower bounds activating under different conditions:

**When $A_t > 0$ (a good action)**: the update direction should increase $r_t(\theta)$. Clipping imposes an upper bound of $1+\varepsilon$ on $r_t$ — any value exceeding it is truncated. Even if a good action carries a high advantage, the policy probability cannot grow without bound in that direction.

**When $A_t < 0$ (a bad action)**: the update direction should decrease $r_t(\theta)$. Clipping imposes a lower bound of $1-\varepsilon$ on $r_t$, preventing the policy probability from being reduced excessively.

```

As shown, $r_t$ is constrained by clipping only in the "advantage-consistent direction": the upper bound $1+\varepsilon$ activates when $A_t > 0$, and the lower bound $1-\varepsilon$ activates when $A_t < 0$. Once $r_t$ crosses the corresponding boundary, the gradient becomes zero and the update stops.

A question remains, however: what if $r_t$ crosses the boundary in the **opposite** direction — for instance, $A_t > 0$ calls for increasing $r_t$, yet $r_t$ has fallen below $1-\varepsilon$? Can the clipping term handle this case on its own? This is precisely the reason the outer $\min$ exists.

### The Role of the Minimum

The clipping term already constrains $r_t$ within $[1-\varepsilon, 1+\varepsilon]$. Why is the outer $\min$ still necessary? The reason lies in the case of opposite-direction overshoot.

Let $\varepsilon = 0.2$ (clipping interval $[0.8, 1.2]$) and $A_t = 2$ (a good action, so $r_t$ should increase). Suppose an update goes in the wrong direction: $r_t$ decreases to $0.5$, falling below the lower bound $0.8$. The two approaches now yield different outcomes:

| Approach                                | Objective value      | Gradient                              | Outcome                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Pure clip $\text{clip}(r_t,0.8,1.2)A_t$ | $0.8 \times 2 = 1.6$ | zero (objective is constant here)     | policy stalls, cannot return              |
| $\min$ selects the unclipped $r_t A_t$  | $0.5 \times 2 = 1.0$ | nonzero, directed toward larger $r_t$ | policy pulled back into the safe interval |

$\min$ compares $1.6$ and $1.0$ and selects the smaller value, $1.0$ — the unclipped term. Its gradient points in the direction of increasing $r_t$, pushing the policy back inside the clipping interval. Under pure clipping, the objective is constant in this region, so the gradient is zero and the policy cannot return on its own.

The four cases are summarized below:

| $A_t$ | $r_t$ position        | Update direction                     | $\min$ selects  | Result                           |
| ----- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| $> 0$ | above $1+\varepsilon$ | consistent with $A_t$, out of bounds | clipped value   | update stops                     |
| $< 0$ | below $1-\varepsilon$ | consistent with $A_t$, out of bounds | clipped value   | update stops                     |
| $> 0$ | below $1-\varepsilon$ | **opposite to $A_t$**                | unclipped value | **pulled back to safe interval** |
| $< 0$ | above $1+\varepsilon$ | **opposite to $A_t$**                | unclipped value | **pulled back to safe interval** |

**First two rows:** the update direction is consistent with $A_t$; only the magnitude is excessive and crosses the boundary. $\min$ selects the clipped value, the gradient becomes zero, and the update stops — identical to pure clipping.

**Last two rows:** the update direction is opposite to $A_t$. For instance, $A_t > 0$ indicates $r_t$ should increase, yet $r_t$ has fallen below the lower bound $1-\varepsilon$. Pure clipping yields zero gradient here, leaving the policy unable to correct itself; $\min$ selects the unclipped value in these two rows, preserving a gradient that pushes $r_t$ back toward the safe interval.

**The role of $\min$ is to preserve a corrective gradient when the update direction is wrong, allowing the policy to return to the clipping interval.**

> Replacing $\min$ with $\max$ would cause the first two rows to "encourage further excursions beyond the boundary", entirely defeating the clipping mechanism. Therefore $\min$ is required.

## Visualizing the Clipping Mechanism

The following code illustrates the behavior of the clipped objective:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# ==========================================
# Visualize the PPO Clip objective
# ==========================================
epsilon = 0.2
r = np.linspace(0.0, 2.0, 500)  # policy ratio r_t(θ)

def ppo_clip_objective(r, A, eps=0.2):
    """PPO clipped objective: L = min(r * A, clip(r, 1-eps, 1+eps) * A)"""
    r_clipped = np.clip(r, 1 - eps, 1 + eps)
    return np.minimum(r * A, r_clipped * A)

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))

# Case: A > 0
A_pos = 1.0
obj_pos = ppo_clip_objective(r, A_pos)
ax1.plot(r, r * A_pos, 'b--', alpha=0.5, label='Unclipped: r × A')
ax1.plot(r, obj_pos, 'r-', linewidth=2, label='PPO: min(r×A, clip(r)×A)')
ax1.axvline(x=1+epsilon, color='gray', linestyle=':', label=f'1+ε={1+epsilon}')
ax1.axvline(x=1-epsilon, color='gray', linestyle=':', label=f'1-ε={1-epsilon}')
ax1.set_title('A > 0 (good action)')
ax1.set_xlabel('Policy ratio r_t(θ)')
ax1.set_ylabel('Objective value')
ax1.legend()

# Case: A < 0
A_neg = -1.0
obj_neg = ppo_clip_objective(r, A_neg)
ax2.plot(r, r * A_neg, 'b--', alpha=0.5, label='Unclipped: r × A')
ax2.plot(r, obj_neg, 'r-', linewidth=2, label='PPO: min(r×A, clip(r)×A)')
ax2.axvline(x=1+epsilon, color='gray', linestyle=':', label=f'1+ε={1+epsilon}')
ax2.axvline(x=1-epsilon, color='gray', linestyle=':', label=f'1-ε={1-epsilon}')
ax2.set_title('A < 0 (bad action)')
ax2.set_xlabel('Policy ratio r_t(θ)')
ax2.legend()

plt.suptitle('Behavior of the PPO Clip objective (ε=0.2)', fontsize=14)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig("ppo_clip_visualization.png", dpi=150)
print("Saved visualization of the clipped objective")
```

Running this code shows: when $A > 0$, the objective becomes flat once $r_t > 1.2$ (the gradient goes to zero and the update stops); when $A < 0$, the objective becomes flat once $r_t < 0.8$. This is the core effect of PPO clipping — once the policy ratio leaves the safe interval, the gradient automatically vanishes.

## Sensitivity to $\varepsilon$

The choice of $\varepsilon$ directly affects training dynamics. The table below summarizes practical experience:

| ε value | Update size | Training speed           | Stability        | Typical use case                         |
| ------: | ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|    0.05 | very small  | very slow                | extremely stable | fine-tuning an already trained policy    |
|     0.1 | small       | slower                   | stable           | LLM alignment (large models are fragile) |
|     0.2 | medium      | moderate                 | moderate         | games/control tasks (a common default)   |
|     0.3 | larger      | faster                   | unstable         | quick experiments/simple tasks           |
|     0.5 | very large  | fast but often collapses | very unstable    | not recommended                          |

In LLM alignment, a smaller $\varepsilon$ (around 0.1 or less) is commonly used, because the policy space of a language model is larger and more brittle: a single poorly controlled update can degrade the model's general language ability (for instance, losing an already acquired language).

<details>
<summary>Question: If PPO clipping makes training "too conservative," can we speed it up without sacrificing stability?</summary>

Several common strategies are used in practice:

1. **Adaptive ε**: PPO-PPG (Phasic Policy Gradient) suggests using a larger ε early in training and gradually shrinking it later, like “take big steps to explore first, then take small steps to refine.”
2. **More update epochs per batch**: PPO commonly performs multiple epochs (often 10) over the same batch of data. If clipping makes each step small, increasing the number of epochs can accumulate a meaningful overall update.
3. **Early stopping based on KL divergence**: monitor the KL divergence during optimization, and stop early if KL exceeds a threshold within an epoch. This effectively combines the TRPO idea (a KL constraint) with PPO’s clipping.

In practice, the second approach is the most common. PPO’s default `n_epochs=10` is already motivated by the idea that clipping limits per-step movement, so multiple passes are used to accumulate sufficient progress.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question: TRPO is more theoretically principled. Why does industry almost always choose PPO?</summary>

Because in engineering practice, “simple and reliable” usually beats “theoretically perfect.”

TRPO requires second-order machinery (Hessian-vector products). On large models this is slow, complex to implement, and easy to get wrong. PPO, in contrast, can be implemented with a simple `torch.clamp` and a `min`, often in under ten lines of code.

The PPO paper (2017) also shows empirically that PPO matches TRPO and often performs as well or better across many tasks. One reason is that TRPO’s own second-order approximations introduce error; solving the constrained problem precisely does not necessarily outperform PPO’s simple heuristic clipping.

This tradeoff becomes even clearer in the LLM era. For a 70B-parameter policy, second-order optimization is simply not practical. OpenAI’s alignment training in InstructGPT and GPT-4 uses PPO rather than TRPO for exactly these reasons.

</details>

This completes the derivation of PPO's clipping mechanism: from the update risk of vanilla policy gradient, to data reuse via importance sampling, to TRPO's KL constraint, and finally to PPO's clipped approximation. But PPO has another key component not covered here: GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation), and the major burden it introduces in LLM alignment — the reward model. See [Advantage Estimation and Reward Modeling](./gae-reward-model).
